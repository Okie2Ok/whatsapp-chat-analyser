She asked about these women to the cofounder of the Computer History Museum (Boston) at that time. Surprisingly the response she received as the women were models, posed in front of the machine to make it look good.  Kathy kept searching and on the 40th anniversary of ENIAC in 1986 she learned that ENIAC was programmed by these six young women - *Fran Bilas, Jean Bartik, Ruth Lichterman, Kay McNulty, Betty Snyder, and Marlyn Wescoff were the six ‘ENIAC Women’*. These six ‘ENIAC Women’ programmed the first all-electronic, programmable computer, the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer) in 1945. There were no programming languages, no manuals, no compilers and no operating systems and the women had to figure out how to program this massive machine on their own. \n",
      "\n",
      "Awards and honors for these women began only after Kathy Kleiman shared stories of these women. In 1997 all six of the ENIAC programmers were inducted into the “Women in Technology Hall of Fame”. Also the U.S. Army has supercomputers named Jean, Kay, and Betty.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even after all these years the computer history community continues to tell us that some group of men invented computing. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some interesting facts about women innovators in computing - \n",
      "\n",
      "- Ada Lovelac helped Charles Babbage in translating the notes of mathematics for his theoretical invention the analytical engine, Lovelace added her own notes, tripling the original text and written first computer algorithm in 1843\n",
      "\n",
      "-Joan Clarke helped Alan Turing to unscramble  messages from the German navy. She was one of the greatest minds behind the code breaking scheme\n",
      "\n",
      "-Dr Grace Murray Hopper, invented COBOL.  COBOL is the first user-friendly business computer software program. She was also the first person to use the term \"bug\" which is used  to describe a glitch in a computer system\n",
      "    \n",
      "-Evelyn Berezin created the world’s first word processor. She protected her invention by establishing her own company named Redactron\n",
      "\n",
      "-According to a documentary on Hedy Lamarr called ‘Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story\", LaMarr filed a patent in 1941 for frequency-hopping technology. It became a precursor to the secure wi-fi, GPS and Bluetooth now used by billions of people around the world   \n",
      "    \n",
      "-Hamilton joined the Lincoln Laboratory at MIT in 1961, and created software to help search for unfriendly aircraft while working on the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment (SAGE) project. It was the first US air defense system.  She has coined the term ‘software engineering’·    \n",
      "    \n",
      "-According to the IT History Society Adele Goldberg developed some of the world's most notable programming languages. These have influenced today’s modern graphical user interfaces    \n",
      "\n",
      "-One of the first software patents was issued to Erna Schneider. She developed a computerized switching system for telephone calls that would replace switchboards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women's roles in IT and computer science continue to thrive today, as women are inventing new technologies. So instead of focusing only on women engineers let us appreciate all women who contributed for betterment of Science and Engineering. Let us appreciate their efforts and cheer them on. \n",

But this year, we are planning with complete preparation. *For that, an awareness session about IET India Scholarship is arranged on 17th May 2023 at 3.00 pm at Faraday Hall* of the Electrical Department.
